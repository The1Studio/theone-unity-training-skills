# GitHub PR Review with Suggested Changes

## Skill Purpose

This skill enables comprehensive GitHub pull request reviews with **actionable suggested changes** that developers can apply directly through GitHub's web UI using the "Commit suggestion" button.

**Key Features:**
- Code review against TheOne Studio standards
- Inline suggested changes using ````suggestion` blocks
- GitHub API integration for programmatic review comments
- Batch suggestion support for efficient fixes
- Complete file replacements when needed

## When This Skill Triggers

**Automatically triggers when:**
- User asks to "review PR" or "review pull request"
- User provides a GitHub PR URL for review
- User asks to "check PR" or "analyze PR changes"
- User requests code review with suggestions
- User asks "help review this PR"

**Manual trigger:**
- User explicitly invokes the skill with `/github-pr-review`

## Quick Reference

### GitHub Suggested Changes Syntax

```markdown
Add nullable directive at the top of the file.

\`\`\`suggestion
#nullable enable

namespace YourNamespace
\`\`\`
```

**Result:** Shows a "Commit suggestion" button in GitHub UI that applies the change when clicked.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Fetch PR Details

```bash
# Get PR information
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER/REPO> --json title,body,files,commits

# Get PR diff
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER/REPO>
```

### Step 2: Analyze Code Changes

- Review against coding standards (e.g., `theone-unity-standards`)
- Identify issues by severity (Critical, Important, Suggestions)
- Categorize issues by file and line number

### Step 3: Create Inline Suggestions

**Use GitHub API to add inline comments with suggestions:**

```bash
# Get latest commit ID
COMMIT_ID=$(gh pr view <PR> --repo <REPO> --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')

# Add inline suggestion comment
gh api \
  --method POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/<OWNER>/<REPO>/pulls/<PR_NUMBER>/comments \
  -f body="<suggestion text with \`\`\`suggestion block>" \
  -f commit_id="$COMMIT_ID" \
  -f path="<file_path>" \
  -F position=<line_number>
```

### Step 4: Add Summary Comment

Add a general comment explaining:
- Number of suggestions added
- How to apply suggestions (individual or batch)
- What issues will be resolved

## Suggestion Types

### 1. Single-Line Suggestions

```markdown
Fix access modifier.

\`\`\`suggestion
public sealed class MyClass
\`\`\`
```

### 2. Multi-Line Suggestions

```markdown
Add nullable directive and fix class.

\`\`\`suggestion
#nullable enable

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public sealed class MyClass
    {
        // class body
    }
}
\`\`\`
```

### 3. Complete File Replacements

For major refactoring, provide complete fixed file in expandable section:

```markdown
<details>
<summary>Click to expand: Complete fixed file</summary>

\`\`\`csharp
// entire file content
\`\`\`
</details>
```

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

1. **Use inline suggestions for fixable issues**
   - Syntax errors, formatting issues
   - Missing keywords, modifiers
   - Simple refactoring

2. **Add suggestions at correct line positions**
   - Use `gh pr diff` to find exact line numbers
   - Use `position` parameter (diff position, not file line number)

3. **Group related changes**
   - Combine related fixes in one suggestion block
   - Example: Add `#nullable enable` + `sealed` keyword together

4. **Provide context**
   - Explain WHY the change is needed
   - Reference coding standards or best practices

5. **Use batch suggestions for multiple fixes**
   - Tell developer about "Add suggestion to batch" option
   - Allows applying all suggestions in one commit

### ❌ DON'T:

1. **Don't suggest changes for non-fixable issues**
   - Architectural problems requiring discussion
   - Design pattern changes
   - Use regular comments for these

2. **Don't create overlapping suggestions**
   - Each suggestion should apply cleanly
   - Avoid suggesting same lines multiple times

3. **Don't suggest changes without explanation**
   - Always include WHY the change is needed
   - Link to relevant documentation or standards

## GitHub API Position Calculation

**Important:** The `position` parameter is the **diff position**, not the file line number.

```bash
# Get diff to see positions
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER/REPO>

# Position starts at 1 for first changed line
# Increments for each line in the diff (context + changes)
```

**Example:**
```diff
@@ -0,0 +1,10 @@
+namespace MyNamespace    # position: 1
+{                        # position: 2
+    public class Foo     # position: 3
+    {                    # position: 4
```

## Common Review Patterns

### Pattern 1: Missing Nullable Directive

**Issue:** Missing `#nullable enable`
**Location:** Line 1 (before namespace)
**Position:** Usually 1

```markdown
Add \`#nullable enable\` directive at the top of the file.

\`\`\`suggestion
#nullable enable

namespace YourNamespace
\`\`\`
```

### Pattern 2: Missing Sealed Keyword

**Issue:** Class should be `sealed`
**Location:** Class declaration line
**Position:** Find in diff

```markdown
Add \`sealed\` keyword to prevent inheritance.

\`\`\`suggestion
    public sealed class YourClass
\`\`\`
```

### Pattern 3: Fields to Properties

**Issue:** Public fields instead of properties
**Location:** Field declaration lines
**Position:** Find in diff

```markdown
Convert field to property with getter.

\`\`\`suggestion
        public Dictionary<string, int> MyProperty { get; } = new();
\`\`\`
```

### Pattern 4: Remove Region Comments

**Issue:** Using `#region` / `#endregion`
**Location:** Region block
**Position:** Find in diff

```markdown
Remove \`#region\` comments - code should be self-organizing.

\`\`\`suggestion
        private readonly UserDataManager userDataManager;

        public MyController(UserDataManager userDataManager)
        {
            this.userDataManager = userDataManager;
        }
\`\`\`
```

## Complete Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Get PR details
PR_NUMBER=984
REPO="The1Studio/TheOneFeature"
COMMIT_ID=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')

# 2. Review code (use theone-unity-standards skill)
# ... analyze code against standards ...

# 3. Add suggestion for file1
gh api \
  --method POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  /repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments \
  -f body="Add \`#nullable enable\` directive.

\`\`\`suggestion
#nullable enable

namespace MyNamespace
\`\`\`" \
  -f commit_id="$COMMIT_ID" \
  -f path="path/to/file1.cs" \
  -F position=1

# 4. Add suggestion for file2
# ... repeat for each issue ...

# 5. Add summary comment
gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --repo $REPO --body "## ✅ Suggestions Ready

I've added 6 inline suggestions. Go to Files Changed tab and click 'Commit suggestion' on each, or use 'Add suggestion to batch' to apply all at once."
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**Works best with:**
- `theone-unity-standards` - For Unity C# code reviews
- `code-reviewer` - For general code quality analysis
- `docs-seeker` - For finding latest library documentation

**Example workflow:**
1. User provides PR URL
2. Trigger `theone-unity-standards` to analyze code
3. Use `github-pr-review` to create suggested changes
4. Developer applies suggestions via GitHub UI

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "404 Not Found" when creating suggestion

**Cause:** Wrong `position` value
**Fix:** Verify position in diff output

```bash
gh pr diff <PR> --repo <REPO> | less
# Count lines from @@ hunk header
```

### Issue: Suggestion doesn't show "Commit suggestion" button

**Cause:** Invalid ````suggestion` syntax
**Fix:** Ensure proper markdown formatting:
- Three backticks
- Word "suggestion" (lowercase)
- Proper code indentation inside block

### Issue: Suggestion applies but breaks code

**Cause:** Incorrect indentation or incomplete context
**Fix:**
- Match existing file indentation exactly
- Include enough context lines
- Test suggestion locally first
